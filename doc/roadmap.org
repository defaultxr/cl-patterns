commit 6006cd5adb3cdfa6ea4080f9e7904717044f442a
and others

* 0.8

** general refactoring

*** more shared/inherited functionality, i.e. make ~pbind~, ~pmeta~, etc. all use a common set of functions to process arguments.

** "quantity objects"

*** basically objects that represent values (i.e. for ~pitch~, ~volume~, etc.) with units to make them easier to use in functions and keep track of what they represent/convert between them. any keys like ~freq~, ~midinote~, ~amp~, etc. should automatically create a quantity object internally and store it in the pattern or event's ~pitch~, ~volume~, etc. key.

** history/future improvements

*** separate history and future (history uses a ringbuffer, future uses a queue).
this should allow for cleaner code in various places, and both features will be less mentally taxing to use.

** replace ~eseq~ with ~timeline~

** "batch patterns"

** backend improvements

*** DONE make each enabled backend its own object so it can have its own parameters rather than relying on global variables
CLOSED: [2022-06-30 Thu 20:28]

*** implement ~backend-disable~ restart.

** clock improvements

*** events with ~quant~ and ~latency~ set to ~0~ should be able to play "immediately" with no quantization like what happens now

*** maybe the clock should "sleep" (end processing thread) when there are no tasks and automatically "wake up" when a task is added?

*** full accuracy ~beat~ method

*** stop using ~local-time~ to calculate times

**** use internal-real-time instead? sbcl's internal-time-units-per-second is 1000000 which is higher than even most "pro audio" sampling rates go, but other implementations may have less. last i checked 1000 was the norm; is it acceptable?

*** allow the clock to be paused and restarted

*** generalize how the clock handles tasks, i.e. method/function to return a list of events within a specific time range, separated from the function that processes said events to backends. likely using ~timeline~.

* 0.9

** envelopes

** ranges (from mutility)

** midi backend (which the more specific midi implementations such as ~alsa-midi~ can inherit from)

** osc backend

** renoise backend

** incudine backend

** continuous ("analog") patterns

** fully implement ~set~, ~play~, ~end~, and ~stop~ event types

** maybe remove ~mono~ event type and just implement some sort of monophony pattern that can be used as a filter/post-processing pattern?

** trigger-based patterns

* 1.0

** remove all (or most) "FIX"es in the code

** implementation of most common/useful SuperCollider patterns (see [[file:sc.org][sc.org]])

* post-1.0

** further backend integration

*** functionality to translate patterns into SuperCollider UGen graphs, Incudine VUGs, etc.
