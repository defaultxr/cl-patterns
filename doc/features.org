#+TITLE: Features

This is a listing of notable features of cl-patterns. For a listing of new features relative to SuperCollider's patterns system, see [[file:sc-differences.org][sc-differences.org]].

- multiple sound server backends are supported:
  - SuperCollider (via the [[https://github.com/byulparan/cl-collider][cl-collider]] library)
  - [[https://incudine.sourceforge.net/][Incudine]]
  - ALSA MIDI (via the [[https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-alsaseq][cl-alsaseq]] library)
- event keys that are different representations of the same concept are automatically converted between each other. For example, if you set the ~amp~ of an event and then try to get its ~db~, cl-patterns converts the amplitude to decibels for you:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (db (event :amp 0.5))
  ;=> -6.0205994
  (amp (event :db -3))
  ;=> 0.70794576
#+END_SRC
See [[file:special-keys.org][special-keys.org]] for a full listing of such keys.
- pbind has "special" keys which alter the functionality of the pattern or pstream.
For consistency, they're typically named after other patterns, i.e. ~pfin~, ~pfindur~, ~psync~, etc.
See [[file:special-keys.org][special-keys.org]] for a full listing.
- it's possible to embed an event's values into another from inside a pattern. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (next-n (pbind :foo (pseq '(1 2 3 4))
                 :embed (pseq (list (event) (event :bar 1 :baz 2) (event :qux 3))))
          3)
  ((EVENT :FOO 1)
   (EVENT :FOO 2 :BAR 1 :BAZ 2)
   (EVENT :FOO 3 :QUX 3))
#+END_SRC
- all pstreams keep a history of previous values that can be referred back to at any time using ~pstream-elt~.
- patterns that have ~repeat~ or ~length~ arguments accept any pattern as "gate" patterns:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (let* ((foo 1)
         (bar (as-pstream (pseq '(1 2 3) (pfunc (lambda () foo))))))
    (print (next-n bar 10)) ;=> (1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1)
    (setf foo 0)
    (print (next-n bar 3)) ;=> (2 3 NIL)
    )
#+END_SRC
- patterns keep track of their "parents":
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defparameter *pat* (pbind :foo (pseq '(1 2 3))))

  (defparameter *pseq* (getf (slot-value *pat* 'cl-patterns::pairs) :foo))

  (pattern-parent *pseq*) ;=> #<PBIND {1003480F53}>

  (eq *pat* (pattern-parent *pseq*)) ;=> T
#+END_SRC
- errors in pattern execution give you the option to remove the task from the clock, or just skip one event.
  - alternatively, "performance mode" gives you the option to automatically remove erroring patterns from the clock, with their error and stack trace recorded to a variable:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (setf *performance-mode* t)

  (play (pbind :x (p/ 1 (pseq '(440 220 0)))))

  ;; ...and then the error occurs:
  ;; WARNING: Task #<CL-PATTERNS::TASK {100438A803}> had error #<DIVISION-BY-ZERO {10043ABA93}>; removed from clock, with state recorded as index 0 in CL-PATTERNS::*PERFORMANCE-ERRORS*.

  (car (last *performance-errors*))
  ;;=> (:TASK #<CL-PATTERNS::TASK {100438A803}>
  ;;    :ERROR #<DIVISION-BY-ZERO {10043ABA93}>
  ;;    :STACK (#<DISSECT::SBCL-CALL [1] ...> ...))
#+END_SRC
- SuperCollider backend: if a node is supplied as a value for a ~pbind~, the synth metadata for that node is used to set its ~input-bus~ or ~output-bus~ as the value instead:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (sc::set-synthdef-metadata :fx :input-bus (bus-audio :chanls 2))

    (defparameter *fx* (proxy :fx
                              (let* ((sig (in.ar (sc::get-synthdef-metadata :fx :input-bus) 2))
                                     (sig (comb-c.ar sig 0.2 (range (lf-noise1.kr 1) 0.04 0.2))))
                                sig)))

    (pb :fx-test
      :instrument :kik
      :dur (p/ 1 (pwhite 1 16))
      :midinote (pwhite 0 127)
      :pan (pwhite -1.0 1.0)
      :out *fx*
      :pfindur 4)

  (play :fx-test)
#+END_SRC
...in the future, this will be even simpler. :)
- ~metadata~ slot for patterns
Hash table associated with each pattern for storing additional data. Access with the ~pattern-metadata~ function. Used by the midifile functionality to include track names/information/etc.
