#+TITLE: SuperCollider Patterns

This is a listing of many of the pattern classes from SuperCollider and various quarks. Any patterns that have equivalents in cl-patterns are marked as such. If a pattern you want is not yet implemented (or not listed here), feel free to open an issue requesting it (or if you're feeling inspired, code it yourself and open a pull request!).

Note that this is just a simple rip of all the ~Pattern~ subclasses and that a pattern's inclusion in this list doesn't necessarily guarantee it will be implemented in the future.

Treat this list as a "quick reference" for users familiar with SuperCollider's patterns. For more in-depth information, have a look at the [[file:sc-differences.org][sc-differences.org]] file instead, which will give more details about the ways cl-patterns differs from SuperCollider.
