(in-package #:cl-patterns)

;; FIX: make versions of these generic functions that will work with supercollider ugens and put them in supercollider.lisp.
;; FIX: need to test weird scales/tunings to make sure they're converting correctly, etc.
;; FIX: implement more keys and event types (see TODO.org)
;; FIX: (play (event :octave 2)) doesn't work properly (it still plays the default note)

(defmacro define-event-special-key (name cases &key (remove-keys t) (define-methods nil) documentation)
  "Define a special key with the key NAME for events (i.e. keys that take their values from other keys, or keys that have default values).

CASES is an alist of cases mapping event key names to forms. When `event-value' is called on an event for the NAME key, then the event is tested for the keys of CASES in the order they're listed. The associated form of the first key of CASES that exists in the event is evaluated to get the value of that call to `event-value'.

If no case is provided with a key that's the same as NAME, one is automatically added at the start with a form that just returns the value of the event's NAME key. If a case is provided with t as its key, that case is always run when found. This allows you to set a default value for the key if none of the other keys from CASES exist in the event.

REMOVE-KEYS is a list of keys to remove from the event when the NAME key is being set with `(setf event-value)'. If t (the default), all keys in CASES will be removed from the event.

DEFINE-METHODS, if true, will cause the macro to define methods for getting and setting the key in an event.

DOCUMENTATION is the documentation string for the function.

Example:

;; (define-event-special-key amp ((:db (db-amp (raw-event-value event :db)))
;;                                (t 0.5))
;;   :define-methods t)

This defines the amp key for events. Since the :amp KEY is implied, it doesn't need to be specified in the CASES. Thus if the event already has an :amp key, its value will be used by default. If no :amp key exists in the event, then the :db FUNC is run if the :db key exists. If neither :amp nor :db exist in the event, then the t key is run, giving a default of 0.5.

Additionally, because :define-methods is true, we can also do the following:

;; (defparameter *foo* (event :amp 0.9))
;; (amp *foo*) ; => 0.9
;; (setf (amp *foo*) 0.7)"
  ;; FIX: does not handle cases with multiple keys. (i.e. (((:foo :bar) 5)))
