;;;; batch.lisp - batch-based patterns.
;;; Batch-based patterns differ from serial patterns in that they yield outputs in batches of zero or more outputs rather than one at a time.
;;; Batches are requested using the `pull' function rather than `next'. `pull' differs in that it includes a DUR parameter which notes the dur in beats worth of outputs to yield for.
;;; For example, (pull my-pattern 4) gets a list worth of the next 4 beats worth of outputs from my-pattern.
